Final project of my 1st year course Introduction to Software Engineering.

During the course we reviewed the key concepts in software engineering, focusing on the stages, the various software lifecycles and software engineering tools are acceptable for use in these stages.
The course discussed requirements analysis, system design, software quality engineering, maintenance, and management
Software projects. I also became familiar with and experience key topics and common tools for engineering Software, such as databases, web design, configuration management and version tracking.
The course structure was project oriented, we worked into groups of 3 students,
And will experience the process of software engineering while building software according to requirements using the tool
Software Engineering. The software development process was iterative and includes about 3 milestones.
